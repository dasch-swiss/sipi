# Building SIPI from Source Code

SIPI's build system is **Bazel** (orchestrating every C/C++ target, the OCI Docker image, and the Rust e2e + smoke tests). Nix's role is reduced to **provisioning a dev shell** with bazelisk + the host tools `rules_foreign_cc` and the `kakadu_archive` repository_rule need on PATH.

All build commands are wrapped by recipes in the root `justfile`. Run `just` to see the full list. Every CI step invokes one of these recipes — there are no inline `bazel ...` calls in any workflow.

## Quick start

```
nix develop                                    # bazelisk + host tools on PATH
just bazel-build                               # bazel build --stamp //src/cli:sipi
./bazel-bin/src/cli/sipi server --config config/sipi.localdev-config.lua
```

`just run` chains the two: it depends on `bazel-build` and starts sipi with the localdev config in one step.

For Bazel concepts, common commands, `--config=` flags, and querying the build graph, see **[Building with Bazel](https://sipi.io/development/bazel/index.md)**.

For dev-shell setup (Determinate Nix install, what the shell provides), see **[Nix dev shell](https://sipi.io/development/nix/index.md)**.

## Prerequisites

### Kakadu (JPEG 2000)

SIPI uses [Kakadu](http://kakadusoftware.com/), a proprietary JPEG 2000 toolkit licensed separately. The archive is published as a release asset on the private [`dasch-swiss/dsp-ci-assets`](https://github.com/dasch-swiss/dsp-ci-assets) repo and is fetched at build time by a custom Bazel `kakadu_archive` repository_rule (`bazel/kakadu.bzl`) that shells out to `gh release download`.

```
gh auth login    # one-time; needs dasch-swiss org membership
just bazel-build # the repository_rule fetches Kakadu on first build
```

CI passes `GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.DASCHBOT_PAT }}` on every Bazel step so the repository_rule resolves there too. See [Kakadu setup](https://sipi.io/development/kakadu/index.md) for details and the version-bump procedure.

### Adobe ICC Color Profiles

SIPI uses Adobe ICC color profiles, which are downloaded automatically by the Bazel build. The user is responsible for reading and agreeing with Adobe's license conditions, which are specified in `Color Profile EULA.pdf` at the repo root.

## Building a Docker image

The Docker image is built by Bazel `rules_oci` (`//src:image`). There is no `Dockerfile` — `src/BUILD.bazel` is the single source of truth. A running Docker daemon is still required for `docker load` / `docker push`, but `docker buildx` is not used (multi-arch manifest assembly happens via `crane index append` on a coordinator job).

```
just bazel-docker-build-arm64  # or -amd64; loads daschswiss/sipi:latest
just bazel-test-smoke          # builds //src:image and probes the loaded image
```

### Per-arch builds (used by CI)

```
just bazel-docker-build-amd64           # build + load amd64 as daschswiss/sipi:latest
just bazel-docker-build-arm64           # build + load arm64
just bazel-docker-extract-debug amd64   # surface sipi-amd64.debug for sentry-cli
just bazel-docker-push-amd64            # push as :v<version>-amd64 + :latest-amd64
just bazel-docker-push-arm64            # push as :v<version>-arm64 + :latest-arm64
just bazel-docker-publish-manifest      # crane index append → daschswiss/sipi:v<version>
```

Each per-arch CI runner builds + pushes only its matching architecture (`target_compatible_with` rejects cross-arch invocations). A coordinator job runs `crane index append` to stitch the two pushed digests into a multi-arch manifest at `daschswiss/sipi:v<version>`.

## Cross-platform builds

The full test matrix runs on macOS-aarch64, linux-x86_64, and linux-aarch64. CI exercises every variant on every platform; a green CI run verifies macOS as well as Linux.

For Linux-target builds from a macOS host, the simplest path is [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev/) or any other lightweight Linux VM with the dev shell available inside it (`nix develop` from a shared workdir). Native cross-compilation via `toolchains_llvm`'s sysroot machinery is on the post-launch roadmap (out of scope for the Y → Y+7 migration).

## All `just` targets

Run `just` with no arguments to see the live list. Key target groups:
