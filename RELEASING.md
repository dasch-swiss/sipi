## Under the Travis hood

Here is what happens in detail when Travis CI is building a git tagged commit. According to the `.travis.yml` file,
the `publish` stage runs the following task:
   
 1. Credentials are read from the `DOCKER_USER` and `DOCKER_PASS` environment variables which are stored encrypted
    inside `.travis.yml`.
 1. The `sipi` docker image is build, tagged, and published.
