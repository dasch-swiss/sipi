# Lists the shared edit sites a NEW image format handler must touch, beyond its
# own src/formats/SipiIO<Fmt>.{h,cpp} pair. This is the mechanically-generated
# source for the `formats` fan-out note in ARCH-MAP.md (DUNE-005): the format
# handlers are NOT added by dropping a file — the dispatch is a shared registry
# + switch + friend fan-out. Re-run to refresh the site list; the count is the
# "cost of a 5th format" the ARCH-MAP entry cites.
#
# Enforcement of the boundary this documents is `docs-only` (convention): there
# is no build-time check that a new format updated every site. A future
# descriptor-registration table (deferred until a real 5th format arrives, per
# ADR-0006) would turn this fan-out into one registration point.
