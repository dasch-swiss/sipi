//! The OTLP metrics bridge: engine counters + the shell's own concurrency
//! signals, exported as OTel observable instruments.
//!
//! The C++ engine keeps its own metrics singleton (cache /
//! decode-memory / admission counters + gauges), read across the seam as a flat
//! [`SipiMetricsSnapshot`]. This module registers an OTel **observable** (async)
//! instrument per field: on each collection the SDK invokes the callback, which
//! snapshots the singleton and reports the current value — a pull, not a push,
//! matching the engine side's pure `sipi_guard`-only read. The meter provider
//! itself is built in [`crate::telemetry`] (fail-open on
//! `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`); with no provider installed the global meter is
//! a no-op and every instrument here silently does nothing.
//!
//! Instrument names are OTel-idiomatic (`sipi.cache.hits`), which the standard
//! OTLP→Prometheus normalization at the collector renders as the existing
//! dashboard names (`sipi_cache_hits_total`). Two snapshot fields are **not**
//! bridged: `rejected_connections_total` and `waiting_connections` are never
//! written on the FFI serve path, so under this shell they stay zero, and the
//! two-lane pool publishes its own `sipi.admission.*` analogues instead.
//!
//! `every_snapshot_field_is_accounted_for` in the tests below is the tripwire: a
//! field added to the snapshot must land in [`COUNTERS`], [`GAUGES`], or that
//! two-name exclusion list, or the test fails. Nothing else detects a metric that
//! stops at the seam — it just never appears in Grafana.
//!
//! opentelemetry 0.31 has no batch-observer API (`register_callback` was
//! removed), so each instrument carries its own callback and each snapshots the
//! singleton. The read is a cheap singleton copy and collection runs at the
//! reader interval (60s), so the ~22 reads per cycle are immaterial.
//!
//! Two instruments are **synchronous** rather than observable, because they
//! record a distribution over individual requests that no end-of-interval poll
//! can reconstruct: [`record_http_duration`] (request latency) and
//! [`record_decode_estimate`] (per-serve decode-memory estimate). Their handles
//! are kept in `OnceLock`s, and a request that arrives before [`register`] ran
//! records nothing.
