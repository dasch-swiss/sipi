In the config file, ``initscript`` contains the path of a Lua-file that
defines a function called ``pre_flight``. The function takes the
parameters ``prefix``, ``identifier`` and, ``cookie``, and is called
whenever an image is requested from the server.

The possible return values of the ``pre_flight`` function are as follows.
Note that Lua function's return value may consist of more than one element
(see `Multiple Results`_):

- Grant full permissions to access the file identified by ``filepath``: ``return 'allow', filepath``
- Grant restricted access to the file identified by ``filepath``, in one of the following ways:
    - Reduce the image dimensions, e.g. to the default thumbnail dimensions: ``return 'restrict:size=' .. "config.thumb_size", filepath``
    - Render the image with a watermark: ``return restrict:watermark=<path-to-watermark>, filepath``
- Deny access to the requested file: ``return 'deny'``

In the ``pre_flight`` function, permission checking can be implemented.
When Sipi is used with Knora_, the ``pre_flight`` function asks
Knora about the user's permissions on the image
(see ``sipi.init-knora.lua``). The scripts ``Knora_login.lua`` and
``Knora_logout.lua`` handle the setting and unsetting of a cookie
containing the Knora session ID.

For more details on the functionality available to Lua scripts running
in Sipi, see :ref:`lua`.
