Overview
########

Sipi is a high-performance media server developed by the
`Digital Humanities Lab`_ at the `University of Basel`_. It is designed to
be used by archives, libraries, and other institutions that need to preserve
high-quality images while making them available online. 

Sipi implements the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF_),
and efficiently converts between image formats, preserving metadata contained
in image files. In particular, if images are stored in `JPEG 2000`_ format,
Sipi can convert them on the fly to formats that are commonly used on the
Internet. Sipi offers a flexible framework for specifying authentication and
authorization logic in Lua_ scripts, and supports restricted access to images,
either by reducing image dimensions or by adding watermarks. It can easily be
integrated with Knora_.

Sipi is `free software`_, released under the `GNU Affero General Public License`_.
It is written in C++ and runs on Linux (including Debian_, Ubuntu_, and CentOS_) and
Mac OS X.

Freely distributable binary releases will be available soon.
