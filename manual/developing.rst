************
Using an IDE
************

CLion
=====

If you are using the `CLion <https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/>`__ IDE,
put ``-j 1`` in Preferences -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> CMake ->
Build options, to prevent CMake from building with multiple processes.
Also, note that code introspection in the CLion editor may not work until
it has run CMake.

Code::Blocks
============

If you are using the `Code::Blocks`_ IDE, you can build a cdb project:

::

    cd build
    cmake .. -G "CodeBlocks - Unix Makefiles"

*************
Writing Tests
*************

We use two test frameworks. We use googletest_ for unit test and pytest_ for
end-to-end tests.

Unit Tests
===========

TBA


End-to-End Tests
=================

To add end-to-end tests, add a Python class in a file
whose name begins with ``test``, in the ``test`` directory. The class's
methods, whose names must also begin with ``test``, should use the ``manager``
fixture defined in ``test/conftest.py``, which handles starting and stopping a
Sipi server, and provides other functionality useful in tests. See the
existing ``test/test_*.py`` files for examples.

To facilitate testing client HTTP connections in Lua scripts, the ``manager``
fixture also starts and stops an ``nginx`` instance, which can be used to
simulate an authorization server. For example, the provided ``nginx``
configuration file, ``test/nginx/nginx.conf``, allows ``nginx`` to act as a
dummy Knora_ API server for permission checking: its ``/v1/files`` route
returns a static JSON file that always grants permission to view the requested
file.

*********************
Commit Message Schema
*********************

When writing commit messages, we stick to this schema:

::

    type (scope): subject
    body

Types:

- feature (new feature for the user)
- fix (bug fix for the user)
- docs (changes to the documentation)
- style (formatting, etc)
- refactor (refactoring production code, e.g. renaming a variable)
- test (adding missing tests, refactoring tests)
- build (changes to CMake configuration, etc.)
- enhancement (residual category)

Example:

::

    feature (HTTP server): support more authentication methods
