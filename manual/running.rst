Running Sipi
############

.. contents:: :local:

After following the instructions in :ref:`building`, you will find the executable
``local/bin/sipi`` in the source tree.

It can be run either as simple command-line image converter or as a server.


**********************************************
Running Sipi As a Command-line Image Converter
**********************************************

Convert an image file to another format:

::

   local/bin/sipi --format [output format] --fileIn [input file] [output file]

Compare two image files:

::

   local/bin/sipi --Compare file1 --Compare file2 


************************
Running Sipi As a Server
************************

::

   local/bin/sipi --config [config file]

Sipi logs its operations using syslog_.

*******************
Configuration Files
*******************

Sipi's configuration file is written in Lua_. You can make your own configuration file by
adapting ``config/sipi.config.lua``.

- Check that the port number is correct and that your operating system's firewal
  does not block it.
- Set ``imgroot`` to the directory containing the files to be served.
- Create the directory ``cache`` in the top-level directory of the source tree.

For more information, see the comments in ``config/sipi.config.lua``.

Using Sipi with Knora
=====================

If you are using Sipi with Knora_, you can adapt ``config/sipi.knora-config.lua``.

HTTPS Support
=============

Sipi supports SSL/TLS encryption if the OpenSSL_ library is installed. You will
need to install a certificate; see ``config/sipi.config.lua`` for instructions.

IIIF Prefixes
=============

Sipi supports `IIIF image URLs`_.

If the configuration property ``prefix_as_path`` is set to ``true``, the IIIF
``prefix`` portion of the URL is interpreted as a subdirectory of ``imgroot``,
and Sipi looks for the requested image file in that subdirectory. Otherwise,
it looks for the file in ``imgroot``.
